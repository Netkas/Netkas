# ❓ Who are you?
My online alias is Netkas, I'm a software engineer that was self-taught and didn't go to college or university or have
any sort of real certification for what I do yet I feel like I'm probably doing a better job than someone who spent
thousands of dollars to learn something like this.


# 🎌 Where are you from?
I was born and raised in Canada, during the last decade of my life I've been living in Chile.


# 🌐 What languages can you speak?
 - English
 - Spanish
 - Croatian
 - Mandarin Chinese


# 🔨 What do you do for a living?

I'm currently struggling to find a job, but I would like to become a police officer. You may ask, why not get a role
as a programmer or IT specalist? I have a few reasons for that.

  - As much as I enjoy programming, It tends to be stressful, I love doing this as a hobby because it allows me to
    play around a sandbox and create whatever comes to mind. But as a job? I find it stressful to understand what
    the client wants and the deadlines and or future issues. So yeah, I rather not.
  - Most jobs in the programming field or IT field requires certification or a diploma, i have neither. But that's
   fine, because I get the satisfcation of knowing that someone with a diploma or certificate often has no idea what
   they're doing and ends up creating inefficent solutions.

At the moment, I'm using my free to work on Intellivoid Technologies and maybe hopefully I can earn some income from
that. It's also a good way to show the world what I can do with a lot of time.

*btw i'm the founder of intellivoid*
